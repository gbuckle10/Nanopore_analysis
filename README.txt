Sample data from https://epi2me.nanoporetech.com/rrms2022.07/

First thing to do is run script.sh to download the fast_5 data from the Nanopore sample data.
    I think script.sh needs to be run using git bash


Basecalling - Use Dorado to do the basecalling
    Install Dorado (install it into the folder for this project, but if I put this on git it should be in .gitignore):
    NOTE ----- I HAD TO DOWNLOAD AN OLD VERSION OF DORADO TO DO THE BASECALLING FOR THE SAMPLE DATASET
